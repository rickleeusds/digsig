Digital Signatures Group

# **Purpose:**

The USDS Digital Signatures group (a collaboration between HQ and agency teams from all COP disciplines) met on April 13 at the DDS offices at the Pentagon. In this exploratory session concensus was reached on the purpose of the group - to define legal requirements, and deliver codified best practices, in the form of guidance. 

This guidance document will address several of the most common Digital/Electronic Signature requirements scenarios encountered by agency technology teams and provide best practice remedies to each. Agencies will be enabled to self-identify the specific needs of their projects and map these to recommended remedies.
